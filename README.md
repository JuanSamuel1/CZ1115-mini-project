# Olist Market Analysis
<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repo is my data science school project created by me and two other friends, Subeen and Ruyi. After several discussion, we decided to choose the Olist Market Dataset from Kaggle. Subsequently, we tried to formulate several problems to answer from the datasets. We decided that we want to see any specific cause for bad and good reviews of the products. The data is separated into several datasets, thus, we need to combine and take only the columns we need to decrease the table size. 

After finished cleaning with the data, we started to analyse the data by plotting the data and the correlation. We also try to do further analysis using sentiment analysis. We try to make a machine learning model using random forest classifier to support the hypothesis. Our conclusion for this project is reviews are strongly related to delivery time. How fast or slow the delivery really affects how people will give reviews. Hence, to increase customer satisfaction, we suggest the business to improve their logistics system.

From this project, I learned a lot about formulating problems, cleaning data, analysing data, creating machine learning models, and coming up with conclusion. Apart from that, I also strenghtened my communication and teamwork skills. Hope this project is useful! :)
