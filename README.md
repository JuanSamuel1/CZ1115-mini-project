## About The Project

![project screenshot](https://github.com/JuanSamuel1/Money-Bot/blob/master/money-bot.PNG)

This repo is my data science school project created by me and two other friends, Subeen and Ruyi. After several discussion, we decided to choose the Olist Market Dataset from kaggle. Subsequently, we tried to formulate several problems to answer from the datasets. The data is separated into several datasets, thus, we need to combine and take only the columns we need to decrease the table size.
